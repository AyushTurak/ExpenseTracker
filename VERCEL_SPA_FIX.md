# Vercel SPA 404 Fix

## Issue
**Error ID:** `bom1::qx6g8-1761557930550-b50dc0fd7743`

When refreshing or directly accessing deep links (e.g., `/login`, `/dashboard`, `/transactions`) on the Vercel-hosted site, users encountered a `404: NOT_FOUND` error.

## Root Cause
Two configuration issues were preventing proper SPA routing:

1. **Missing Vercel rewrites:** Vercel didn't know to serve `index.html` for all client-side routes
2. **Incorrect Vite base path:** The `vite.config.ts` had `base: './'` which generated relative asset paths, causing issues with nested routes

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `vercel.json`
Added SPA rewrite configuration to serve `index.html` for all routes:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

This tells Vercel to serve the SPA's `index.html` for any route, allowing React Router to handle client-side routing.

### 2. Fixed `vite.config.ts`
Changed the base path from relative to absolute:

```diff
- base: './',
+ base: '/',
```

This ensures asset paths in the built `index.html` use absolute paths (`/assets/...`) instead of relative paths (`./assets/...`), which is essential for routes at different depths.

## Verification Steps

### Local Build Test
```bash
npm install
npm run build
# Check that dist/index.html uses absolute paths (/assets/...)
```

### Production Test (After Deployment)
1. Open the app root: `https://your-domain.com/`
2. Navigate directly to: `https://your-domain.com/login`
3. Refresh the page - should load the app, not a 404
4. Test other routes: `/dashboard`, `/transactions`, `/analytics`, `/categories`, `/settings`
5. All should work without 404 errors

## Expected Results
✅ All client-side routes work when accessed directly
✅ Refreshing any page maintains the correct route
✅ No more `404: NOT_FOUND` errors for SPA routes
✅ Asset loading works correctly at all route depths

## Deployment
After merging this fix, Vercel will automatically redeploy with the new configuration. The `vercel.json` file will be respected and all SPA routes will function correctly.
